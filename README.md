## Description
With the provided data, our task is to analyze the key drivers of long Average Handle Time (AHT) and Average Speed to Answer (AST), including agent performance, call types, and customer sentiment, particularly during high-volume periods. We aim to propose improvements to the IVR system to reduce escalations and accurately categorize call reasons to streamline processes. This analysis will provide actionable insights to optimize operations, enhance customer satisfaction, and improve overall efficiency.

## Problem Solved
There is very little variation in AHT due to agent tone. We conclude that agent tone does not influence call timings as AHT remains consistent across different tones.

The percentage difference between the average handling time for the most frequent and least frequent call reasons is 50.32%, with "IRROPs" (Irregular Operations) taking the most time and "Unaccompanied Minor" the least.

From the bar plot, it can be seen that some call reasons occur frequently and have significantly higher counts than others. These are the recurring issues for which customers frequently seek support, indicating areas where operational efficiency can be improved.
